## 6️⃣ Press Enter to accept the default save location.

**Optionally set a passphrase** (can be empty – just press Enter)


---

## 7️⃣ Git will generate a keyfingerprint and an image

## 8️⃣ Add Your SSH Key to the SSH Agent 🗝  
  This tells Windows/Git to remember your SSH key in memory so you don’t have to type the passphrase every time you push or pull:

⚠️**WATCH OUT FOR SPACES** when you type in the command

---

## 9️⃣  Add Your SSH Key to GitHub
**Copy the SSH key** (in Git Bash, type this):  
    
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
  
This command will print your **public SSH key** in Git Bash.  

**Then:**  
1. Go to **GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys**  
2. Click **New SSH key**
   <img width="1599" height="261" alt="7 - new SSH key" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/428f1f59-48ac-48a8-a6cc-05a670ceeb5c" />
   
3. Give it a title (e.g., `"My Windows PC"`)  
4. Paste the key from Git Bash  
5. Click **Add SSH key**

## 🔟 Test the Connection

<img width="580" height="580" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65c78d81-7606-4996-aed9-90f6179dbe12" />

   In bash, type 
   ```bash
   "ssh -T git@github.com"
```
   
**The message will be :**
**"The authenticity of host 'github.com (140.82.121.3)' can't be established.**
**This key is not known by any other names.**
**Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?"** 

## Here’s what it means in plain English:

"Permanently added 'github.com'..." → Your computer now trusts GitHub’s fingerprint, so it won’t ask you again.
"Hi MihaelaChicu! You've successfully authenticated..." → GitHub has confirmed your SSH key matches your account. You’re officially connected. ✅

<img width="577" height="39" alt="9 - Test the connection and succeed" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/378801b3-2e0c-4d55-8251-f3956b1a1791" />

"...but GitHub does not provide shell access." → Normal message. GitHub doesn’t give you a remote terminal, only Git repo access.



**Don't panic**

This is the first time you’re connecting to GitHub from this computer. Should I trust this server’s fingerprint?”
It’s a security handshake to make sure you’re actually talking to GitHub and not some fake server.

**Type - yes**

then you will see "You've successfully authenticated" message
